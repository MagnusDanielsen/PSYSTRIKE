# PSYSTRIKE


Psystrike is a old project of mine which i created in 2018.
The whole concept is to create a decentralized military grade encrypted chat and call software.
The software will use a client-server method with EAESE encryption method both ways. 

# WHAT IS EAESE?
EAESE is my own encryption method using two well known encryption algorithms to create a more secure way of communicating.

# WHEN WILL WE SEE PSYSTRIKE IN ITS FINAL FORM?
Psystrike will not be a finished product cause of new ideas and probable bug fixes and more secure ways of delivering information




Psystrike will be my final software and a one of a kind product.


- First push will be in early 2021
